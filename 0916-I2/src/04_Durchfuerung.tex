\section{Experimental Procedure}

\subsection{Calibration of the setup with spectra of sodium and mercury}
To verify the data delivered by the spectrometer, as a first measurement a Na-lamp and a Hg-lamp
with discrete emission spectra have been used in the setup without I$_2$-tube.
The positions of the optical elements were adjusted to project an image of the lamps on the entrance slit
of the spectrometer.
The spectra were recorded with \ldots

\subsection{Spectrum of the halogen lamp}
Then, the lamp was replaced by the halogen lamp and its spectrum was measured.

\subsection{Spectrum of iodine}
For the last measurement, the iodine tube was inserted in the optical path and the spectrum was captured.
