\section{Aim of the experiment}
In this experiment the transmission spectrum of iodine will be recorded.
This data provides information about vibrational transitions which accompany the electronic transition from
${}^{1}\Sigma_{0g}^+$ to ${}^3 \Pi_{0u}^-$.
Analysis of the vibrational transitions reveals information about fundamental constants
to describe the I$_2$-molecule:
Vibration constants of ground and excited electronic state, dissociation energies and the shape
of the potential of the nuclei.
