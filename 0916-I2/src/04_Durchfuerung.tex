\section{Experimental Procedure}

\subsection{Calibration of the setup with spectra of sodium and mercury}
To verify the data delivered by the spectrometer, as a first measurement the Na lamp and the Hg lamp
have been used in the setup without I$_2$-tube.
Lens 1 was positioned in a way that after the mirror a beam of constant diameter was formed.
With lens 2 the beam was focused on the entrance slit of the spectrometer.\\
For the Na measurement, the NGG13\footnote{During
the measurement an inconsistency in the naming of the ND filter has been determined:
A 100~times stronger absorption of the NGG13 compared to the NGG11 (as their names suggest) does not seem to occur.
The NGG12 provides stronger absorption than NGG13.}
filter has been used.
The signal was integrated for 2\,ms in the spectrometer and 10 measurements were averaged.\\
The Hg measurement was conducted with the NGG11 filter,
10\,ms integration time and also an averaging of 10 measurements.

\subsection{Spectrum of the halogen lamp}
Then the lamp was replaced by the halogen lamp and its spectrum was measured.
The NGG10 was used, 10\,ms integration time and an averaging of 100 measurements.

\subsection{Spectrum of iodine}
For the last measurement, the iodine tube was inserted in the optical path and the spectrum was captured
with the same settings as for the spectrum of the halogen lamp.
