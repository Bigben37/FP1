\section{Measurement Results and Evaluation}

\subsection{Calibration of the setup with spectra of sodium and mercury}


The calibration of the setup has been carried out measuring the positions of known lines of Sodium and Mercury
(\autoref{img:na:spectrum} and \autoref{img:hg:spectrum}).
The measured data matches the literature values already well.
However, as a small offset is visible over the measured range, a linear fit has been done
to correct the data of the iodine absorption.
The fit and the fitting parameters are shown on \autoref{img:calibrationsystem}.

Furthermore the shortening of the measured wavelengths, which is caused by air, needs to be considered.
Hence a linear fit on the literature values of the refractive index of air has been done and provides another
correcting function which is applied on the measured data for iodine.

\subsection{Spectrum of the halogen lamp}

\autoref{img:hal:spectrum} shows the spectrum of the halogen lamp.
The spectrum looks smooth an no absorption lines are visible.
An approximation with the model of a black body gives no good description of the data,
so probably the emissivity of the lamp changes for different wavelengths.

\subsection{Identification of the 3 progressions in the spectrum of iodine}

  to electronic-vibronic transitions.}
  \label{img:spectrumiodine}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\autoref{img:spectrumiodine} shows the measured transmission spectrum of a halogen lamp through iodine.
The first three progressions
(minima of transmission due to simultaneous electronic and vibronic excitation of iodine molecules)
could be identified and are marked in the
figure\footnote{The exact positions of the lines and
their corrected values (with calibration data of the setup and refraction index of air)
are shown in the Appendix, \autoref{tab:prog1}, \autoref{tab:prog2} and \autoref{tab:prog3}.}.
A closer look at the shape of those ''dips'' yields information about the ratio of the rotation constants
of the ground state and the excited electronic state:
The dips are slightly asymmetric and steeper on their left side. This so called
''red-shadowing'' appears, when the rotation constant of the excited state is \emph{smaller} than
the one of the ground state. As the constants are closely related to the equilibrium distance between the nuclei,
one can see that on excitation the nuclei move away from each other.
